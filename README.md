Meshdep or Mesh Depot for long is a student project dedicated to creating a small network of interconnected nodes to one central computer acting as server which provides cloud storage to users on the front end by using the nodes as the storage devices and the central server as the "communication relay".

Before running, make sure you check the Wiki for our dependencies to not run into any issues when starting the server.

You are free to modify, share, use any part of this however you want. However, treat this is a proof of concept of a cloud storage server, it is not optimized for production and is definitely not secure enough for it. Beyond this, the collaborators are unlikely to maintain this as it's only meant to demonstrate an implementation of a distirbuted network for our Distributed Systems course at our University.

Feel free to try and reach out if you have any questions, will be happy to help.
