Meshdep or Mesh Depot for long is a student project dedicated to creating a small network of interconnected nodes to one central computer acting as server which provides cloud storage to users on the front end by using the nodes as the storage devices and the central server as the "communication relay".

Before running, make sure you check the Wiki for our dependencies to not run into any issues when starting the server.

You are free to modify, share, use any part of this however you want.
