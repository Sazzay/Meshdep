Meshdep or Mesh Depot for long is a student project dedicated to creating a small network of interconnected nodes to one central computer acting as server which provides cloud storage to users on the front end.

Before running, make sure you check the Wiki for our dependencies... Or just debug your way there, albeit more painful.

You are free to modify, share, use any part of this however you want.
